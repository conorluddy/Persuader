# Advanced Yoga Pose Analysis Demo

This directory demonstrates Persuader's sophisticated multi-dimensional relationship analysis using rich yoga pose datasets. It showcases advanced domain knowledge extraction and complex schema validation capabilities.

## üéØ Demo Overview

The advanced yoga demo analyzes **6 dimensions** of pose relationships using comprehensive anatomical and energetic data:

1. **Anatomical Progression** - Poses with same muscles but increased difficulty
2. **Energetic Flow** - Poses with compatible or complementary energy states  
3. **Therapeutic Alternatives** - Gentler alternatives for physical limitations
4. **Counter-poses** - Essential balancing poses (backbends after forward folds)
5. **Preparatory Sequence** - Poses that warm up and prepare the body
6. **Integration Options** - Neutral poses for rest and processing afterward

## üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Rich Data Source

Uses the comprehensive pose dataset from `examples/yoga/poses/` containing:

- **50 detailed poses** with anatomical focus, energy states, and practice context
- **Biomechanical analysis** including muscle engagement and joint actions
- **Practitioner profiles** with experience levels and physical considerations
- **Environmental factors** like space requirements and prop usage
- **Therapeutic information** for modifications and adaptations

## üöÄ Running the Demo

```bash
# From the Persuader root directory
npm run example:yoga-advanced
```

The demo processes the first 10 poses for comprehensive analysis, generating:
- Individual relationship files per pose
- Advanced summary with dimensional breakdowns
- Rich metadata preservation

## üìä Example Output

### Boat Pose (Navasana) - 18 Total Relationships:

  }
}
```

## üî¨ Technical Sophistication

### Schema Complexity
- **Schema complexity: 10** (vs 4 for basic yoga, 8 for exercise)
- **6-dimensional analysis** with sophisticated domain understanding
- **Rich input context** using comprehensive pose metadata
- **Automatic retry/validation** handling complex JSON structures

### Domain Expertise Integration
- **Anatomical safety** considerations for progression recommendations
- **Energy system understanding** for compatible flow sequences
- **Therapeutic knowledge** for modification and adaptation suggestions
- **Sequencing wisdom** for preparation and integration practices

## üéì Key Learning Points

This advanced demo illustrates sophisticated Persuader patterns:

1. **Multi-dimensional Analysis** - Complex relationship extraction (6D vs simple transitions)
2. **Rich Data Utilization** - Leveraging comprehensive domain datasets  
3. **Advanced Schema Design** - Handling complex validation requirements
4. **Domain Expertise Integration** - Encoding specialized knowledge in prompts
5. **Scalable Architecture** - Session-based processing for efficiency
6. **Production Metadata** - Comprehensive result tracking and analysis

The progression from basic ‚Üí exercise ‚Üí advanced demonstrates Persuader's ability to scale from simple validation to sophisticated domain analysis while maintaining the same clean, validated output patterns.

## üß† Domain Knowledge Demonstrated

- **Anatomical Understanding** - Muscle groups, joint actions, movement patterns
- **Energy System Awareness** - Grounding, centering, energizing, calming effects  
- **Therapeutic Applications** - Modifications for injuries and limitations
- **Sequencing Intelligence** - Safe progressions and balancing practices
- **Practice Integration** - Holistic consideration of yoga philosophy and safety

This represents the most sophisticated relationship analysis in the Persuader example suite, showing how the framework can handle expert-level domain knowledge extraction and validation.
