  "context": "Analyze this foundational inversion and identify comprehensive transition relationships. Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana) is one of the most commonly practiced poses, serving as both a strength-builder and a resting pose in flow sequences. Consider the shoulder stability, hamstring length, and weight distribution. Analyze transitions to planks, standing poses, and more advanced arm balances. Factor in wrist sensitivity and various modification options.",
