  "context": "Analyze this foundational yoga pose and identify potential transitions and relationships. Mountain Pose (Tadasana) is the foundation of all standing poses and serves as a reset pose throughout practice. Consider the stability, grounding effects, and natural progressions from this neutral standing position. Analyze both immediate transition possibilities and longer-term progressions for building a complete standing sequence. Factor in the accessibility for all levels and the pose's role in establishing proper alignment.",
