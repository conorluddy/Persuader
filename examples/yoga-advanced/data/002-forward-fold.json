  "context": "Analyze this fundamental forward folding pose and identify transition relationships. Standing Forward Fold (Uttanasana) is a key pose in sun salutations and serves as both an active pose and a resting position. Consider the hamstring flexibility requirements, spinal articulation, and inversion effects. Analyze transitions into arm balances, twists, and back into standing poses. Factor in modifications for tight hamstrings and variations for different body types.",
