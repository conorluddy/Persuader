## üîß Development Patterns

### Schema Design
Each example demonstrates progressively complex schema patterns:

```typescript
// Simple: Basic object validation
const SimpleSchema = z.object({
  pose: z.string(),
  transitions: z.array(z.string())
});

// Advanced: Multi-dimensional with rich metadata
const AdvancedSchema = z.object({
  anatomicalProgression: z.array(z.string()),
  energeticFlow: z.array(z.string()),
  therapeuticAlternatives: z.array(z.string()),
  // ... 6 total dimensions
});

// Expert: Multi-stage compound schemas
const CompoundWorkoutSchema = z.object({
  profile: FitnessProfileSchema,
  exercises: ExerciseSelectionSchema,  
  structure: WorkoutStructureSchema,
  progression: ProgressionPlanSchema,
  recovery: RecoveryIntegrationSchema
});
```

### Prompt Management
External prompts enable reusability and maintainability:

```typescript
// Basic context
export const YOGA_TRANSITION_CONTEXT = `You are analyzing yoga pose transitions...`;

// Professional persona
export const STRENGTH_COACH_LENS = `You are a certified strength coach with expertise in...`;

// Multi-stage context evolution
export const COACH_CONTEXT = `You are an expert fitness coach and exercise physiologist...`;
```

### Session Patterns
Examples demonstrate different session usage patterns:

```typescript
// Simple: Context reuse
const sessionContext = createSessionContext(allPoses);
for (const pose of poses) {
  await persuade({ context: sessionContext, sessionId });
}

// Advanced: Context evolution across stages
let sessionId = await createSession(coachContext);
const profile = await assessFitness(userInput, sessionId);
const exercises = await selectExercises(profile, sessionId); 
// ... context builds through stages
```

// Extend validation schemas in schemas/ directories
export const EnhancedSchema = BaseSchema.extend({
  newField: z.string().describe("Additional analysis dimension")
});
```

### Creating New Prompts
```typescript
// Add domain expertise in prompts/ directories
export const SPECIALIST_LENS = `You are a specialist in...`;
```

### Extending Analysis

  ...existingAnalysis,
  newDimension: await analyzeNewAspect(input)
};
```
