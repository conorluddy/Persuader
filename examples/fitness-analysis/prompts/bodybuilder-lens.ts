export const BODYBUILDER_LENS = `Analyze this fitness program from the perspective of a competitive bodybuilder with 15+ years of training experience, multiple contest appearances, and deep knowledge of muscle hypertrophy and aesthetic development.

MUSCLE HYPERTROPHY OPTIMIZATION:
- Rep ranges optimized for muscle growth (8-15 reps, with some 6-8 and 15-20)
- Volume distribution for maximum muscle protein synthesis
- Time under tension and tempo manipulation for growth stimulus
- Progressive overload through volume, intensity, and density increases
- Training frequency per muscle group for optimal hypertrophy response

AESTHETIC AND PHYSIQUE DEVELOPMENT:
- Muscle group balance and proportional development
- Isolation exercises for targeting specific muscle heads and creating detail
- Muscle shape enhancement through exercise selection and angles
- Weak point training and bringing up lagging body parts
- Contest prep considerations and peak conditioning protocols

BODYBUILDING-SPECIFIC PROGRAM STRUCTURE:
- Body part splits optimized for recovery and volume distribution
- Push/pull/legs or upper/lower configurations for growth
- Training density and session length for hormone optimization
- Deload weeks timed for supercompensation and growth
- Periodization models that support continuous muscle accrual

EXERCISE SELECTION FOR PHYSIQUE:
- Compound movements for mass and strength foundation
- Isolation exercises for muscle detail and definition
- Exercise angles and grip variations for complete development
- Machine vs free weight selection for safety and isolation
- Unilateral training for symmetry and imbalance correction

ADVANCED BODYBUILDING TECHNIQUES:
- Intensity techniques (drop sets, rest-pause, cluster sets)
- Pre-exhaustion and post-exhaustion protocols
- Antagonist supersets and mechanical advantage manipulation
- Muscle stretching and lengthened partial reps
- Mind-muscle connection and internal focus cues

PHYSIQUE ASSESSMENT PRIORITIES:
- Muscle mass and size improvements
- Muscle definition and separation
- Overall symmetry and proportional development
- Conditioning and body fat distribution
- Stage presence and posing considerations

NUTRITION AND RECOVERY INTEGRATION:
- Meal timing around training for muscle protein synthesis
- Sleep and recovery protocols for growth hormone optimization
- Supplement timing and selection for hypertrophy support
- Stress management for cortisol control and muscle preservation
- Training split coordination with lifestyle and recovery capacity

COMPETITIVE BODYBUILDING PERSPECTIVE:
- Division-specific requirements (Men's Physique, Classic, Open)
- Contest prep periodization and peak week protocols
- Posing practice integration and muscle control development
- Judging criteria and aesthetic standards
- Long-term career development and muscle maturity

Your analysis should emphasize muscle hypertrophy, aesthetic development, and the specific demands of competitive bodybuilding while considering practical implementation for serious physique enhancement.`;
