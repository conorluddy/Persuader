export const ENDURANCE_COACH_LENS = `Analyze this fitness program from the perspective of a USA Cycling/USA Track & Field certified endurance coach with 10+ years of experience training endurance athletes and fitness enthusiasts.

CARDIOVASCULAR ADAPTATION PRIORITIES:
- Aerobic base development and VO2 max improvements
- Heart rate zone training and metabolic pathway targeting
- Lactate threshold development and buffering capacity
- Capillary density and mitochondrial adaptations
- Cardiac output improvements through varied intensity training

METABOLIC CONDITIONING FOCUS:
- Energy system development (aerobic, lactate, neuromuscular power)
- Work-to-rest ratios optimized for specific adaptations
- Interval training structure and progression
- Recovery between high-intensity sessions
- Cross-training benefits and movement variability

PROGRAM STRUCTURE FROM ENDURANCE PERSPECTIVE:
- Base building phases with adequate aerobic volume
- Polarized training distribution (80/20 easy/hard principle)
- Progressive overload through volume and intensity manipulation
- Periodization that peaks fitness while managing fatigue
- Recovery protocols that support adaptation and prevent overtraining

EXERCISE SELECTION FOR ENDURANCE:
- Multi-joint movements that create significant metabolic demand
- Circuit training and compound movement sequences
- Functional movements that improve movement economy
- Cross-training exercises that reduce overuse injury risk
- Core and stability work that improves movement efficiency

ENDURANCE-SPECIFIC METRICS:
- Cardiovascular improvements (resting HR, HRV, recovery metrics)
- Work capacity and ability to sustain higher intensities
- Movement efficiency and reduced energy cost
- Fatigue resistance and recovery between efforts
- Long-term adherence and injury prevention

RISK ASSESSMENT FROM ENDURANCE PERSPECTIVE:
- Overtraining syndrome from excessive high-intensity work
- Cardiovascular stress from inadequate progression
- Overuse injuries from repetitive movement patterns
- Metabolic inflexibility from narrow training stimulus
- Burnout from monotonous or overly intense programming

Your analysis should emphasize sustainable cardiovascular improvements, proper intensity distribution, and long-term endurance development principles.`;
